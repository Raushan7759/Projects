🔐 Authentication
Users sign up/log in using JWT. The backend secures endpoints and Socket.IO connections. Frontend stores token in local storage or cookies and attaches it to HTTP and socket requests.

💬 Socket.IO Communication
Namespaces for public channels or groups

Events:

joinRoom, leaveRoom

chatMessage

typing, stopTyping

imageUpload

Check server/controllers/socket.js or similar for full event flow.

📁 File Uploads
Images are uploaded via backend endpoint (e.g. /api/uploads) using Multer and saved in uploads/, then sent to chat clients via Socket messages.

🛡️ Error Handling & Validation
Express routes include parameter validation and error handling

Socket.IO events verified, and appropriate acknowledgements are sent

✅ Testing
(Optional) Include any test runners (like Jest or Mocha) and describe how to run tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd server
npm test

### 👍 Tips

- Adjust **features** and **tech stack** depending on your actual implementation.
- Add **screenshots** under a **.github/assets/** folder to illustrate the UI, and include them in the README.
- If you use Docker, include a `docker-compose.yml` and update installation instructions.
- Add **live demo links** or **deployment instructions** if available.
